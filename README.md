# Customer-Account-Assessment
 
Customer Account Assessment:
 - The aim of the assessment is to opening a new "current account" of an existing customer with the use of an API
 - The Web project and API projects both are setup as the startup projects
 - Running (F5) should start up the application
 - On the home/landing page should open the generic ASP page but "Account" label/tab should be seen and can be clicked
 - CustomerId and Initial Credit accept input (both 1)
 - Which should return some data

This is as far as I could get and not able to create test at this stage
